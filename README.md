bash_prompt
===========

A fairly simple script to add some additional functionality to your bash prompt.

## Installation:

First, clone the repository

Then, symlink the bash prompt file in the repo to your actual bash_prompt file:
```ln -s <bash_prompt file> ~/.bash_prompt```

Lastly, add the following line to either ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc (depending on which one you use):
```. ~/.bash_prompt' in ~/.profile```
